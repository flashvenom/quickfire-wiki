## Updating the list
1. Open `Data/SeedInitialData.cs` and update `SeedProducts` (Id, Code, Description).
2. Run the seeding script or EF migration to add any new rows (IDs are ints; keep them stable for references).
3. Update dropdowns/templates referencing product codes (Renewal tasks, Proposler templates, SmartPaste prompts).
4. Refresh this wiki table (and any vector data tied to `ProductTypes`).

Use this table when building prompts ("Suggest an umbrella upsell"), designing forms, or mapping coverage-specific workflows.
